        Over my {{yearsOfExperience}}-year career, I've driven major modernization initiatives, migrating databases with 
        <strong>60% performance gains</strong>, rebuilding enterprise integrations, and implementing secure B2B 
        authentication systems.

      <p class="break-inside-avoid">
        I focus on solving problems, not defending specific technologies. My work spans distributed 
        systems, data architecture, CI/CD automation, and infrastructure optimization. I mentor 
        developers, collaborate across teams, and maintain documentation that enables long-term success.

        Currently pursuing my <strong>Master's in Computer Science at Georgia Tech</strong>, where I'm exploring AI and 
        advanced algorithms, directly informing how I approach production challenges.

      <p class="break-inside-avoid">
        Outside work, you'll find me in programming communities debating implementations, contributing to technical 
        discussions, or diving into system design problems. I genuinely love solving hard problems that improve 
        systems and deliver results.
